## Basics of drug development for those unfamiliar with the industry
The drug development process stands as one of the most intricate and regulated endeavors in the global economy. The journey from conceptual molecule to marketable medicine is not only technically demanding and resource-intensive, but also pivotal for societal well-being, as it births the vast majority of medical advancements we rely on. 
It's becoming increasingly clear that the substantial costs associated with this process are a primary driver of the high prices afflicting today's pharmaceutical market. Grappling with the dual challenge of maintaining drug affordability without curtailing the innovation essential for new medical discoveries, demands a fundamental grasp of the pharmaceutical development pipeline.

Developing a new medicine takes an average of 10-15 years.
